# How to use `pancake-graphs` repo:


### Option 1: Directly download the csv files, and use them as you please.

### Option 2: Get the programs set up locally.

Step 1. Clone the repo into your target directory.

Step 2. `cd` into that directory.

Step 3. Run `python3 pancake.py` or `python3 burntpancake.py`.

Step 4. Follow the prompts on screen. Most commonly, enter the desired number of pancakes in the graph, enter `s` for an eigenvalue summary, and then enter `sdd` to display the values. Each step can take some time, so wait for the prompt to show up before entering the next command.
